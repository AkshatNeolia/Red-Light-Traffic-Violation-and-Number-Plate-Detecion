# RED-LIGHT-TRAFFIC-VIOLATION-AND-NUMBER-PLATE-DETECTION
An autonomous traffic red-light violation detection system was built, which has the potential to significantly improve transportatsion management in smart cities. The operation of the system is mostly dependent on contemporary computer vision methods, which were implemented in OpenCV inside the Python environment.
